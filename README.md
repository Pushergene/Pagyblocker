Extremly fast, block by domain. Updated, 

Its actually just a fork from a 3 years old Extension. 
The Filter list is very outdated there, calling home. This Extension doesnt call a single DNS.
For Firefox:
about:config
then xpinstall.signatures.required false
xpinstall.whitelist.required false

I recommend to use uBlock Origin aswell, to block "anti adblock" warnings.
Disable all except "Built in" and "My filters".
Go to https://pushergene.github.io/Filter
There i recommend to enable "Adguard Annoyances" and "German Filters" for Mobile,
because Adguard Annoyances blocks Cookie banners,
but on mobile its only non-bugged with German Filter.
For other languages: https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-ad-filters

Enjoy fast webloading. 
download link is in release page
